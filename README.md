# Pre-Trained-Model-for-Text-Conversational-

Project Overview:
The Text Conversational Model Comparison Project aims to assess and compare various pre-trained models designed for text conversational tasks. "Text conversational" refers to a communication style that mirrors informal, everyday spoken language. This project focuses on evaluating models commonly used in messaging, social media, and informal articles to achieve a natural and approachable tone.
